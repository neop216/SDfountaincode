A fountain code is a type of encoding process that allows the original data to be recovered from sufficiently
large subsets of the encoded data. This property makes them highly desirable in hostile network environments, and thus
perfect for use in space.

Arguably the most easily understandable method of encoding blocks involves combining them with the bitwise exclusive-or
operation. This is the foundation of a subclass of fountain codes called Luby transform (LT) codes. The exact methods of
encoding and decoding used by LT codes are fairly standardized and agreed upon, and this software prototype attempts to
implement those methods.

More advanced and efficient subclasses of fountain code exist, such as Raptor codes, but as most of our research has
been focused on LT fountain codes, the prototype software uses their methodology instead.
